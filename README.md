# Memories 

- Developed a website to share posts and engage in a community through likes and comments.
  - Every user has a profile and can create posts, like and delete them in this MERN stack based application.
- Used ReactJS for the front-end and ExpressJS for the back-end. To ensure security, account activation is done via email, and authentication is implemented through JWT access and refresh tokens.
